     * There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.

     * - `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`.
     * - `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
     * - `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

     * If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique
     * name that describes the behavior. For example:
     *
     * - `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain.
     * - `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.
     *
     * NOTE: The string can be decoded by the standard
     * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams[`URLSearchParams`]
